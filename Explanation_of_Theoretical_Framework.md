Cluster 1 consists of theories of ___equity, attribution, and Justice___
* employee perspective has emerged at the forefront of thsi new exploration
* deal with ramifications of customer aggression/ incivility on employee performance

Cluster 2 consists of ___influence of emtions___, focusing extremely on negative affective responses and not deceptiive behaviors tjat customers adopts.
* the least revolutionary among clusters 

Cluster 3 consists of ___attribution___, revealing that this tehory in conjunction with that of perceived justice offers major tehoretical to service failure literature as a whole and issues of recovery paradox, and  double deviation are sought to be resolved.

Cluster 4 consists of the ___justice theory___, emphasizing the service recovery strategies from the organizational perspective.

## Conclusion 
* Perhaps, among theories which has been used in this field of study, the perceptions and behavoral intentions of customers are mainly explained through justice perceptions, locus, stability, controllability causal attributions
### The need of Perceived Justice
* The most commonly used theories and frameworks include deontic justice theory, attribution theory, expectation-disconfimation paradigm to explain customer cognition, cognitive appraisal theory and affect control theory to explain customer emotions and service domuinant logic for understanding the impact of value co-creation.
* As far as the dominance of justice theory is concerned, it remains largely unchallenged as proven through the emergence of an entire cluster dealing with the concern in addition to its ubiquitous presence in other cluster
  * ___=>___ There are many theories has been introduced in this field of study, however, those theories are still challenged when putting them in different contexts and only justice theory is still remained unchallenged which is good for the authors to use.
  * ___=>___ There is a clear explanation for the over-reliance on the theory of perceived justice that is the ease and convenience this theory offers in the conceptualization of customers reactions to organizational recovery endeavours. It offers a composite construct to measure the cognitive consequences of service delivery and recovery.

### The need of Attribution 
* the locus, stability, and cntrollability have dominanted the SFR discourse
* There is a recommendation from previous study is that the globaility and intentionality in the original attribution model of Weiner may provide the direction for the future research.
