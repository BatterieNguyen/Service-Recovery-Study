# Failure Attribution
___Definition___
  Folkes (1984) states that attribution theory believes that people are rational information processors and that their actions are influenced by causal inferences. Attributions are efforts to allocate responsibility for events. Research has shown that when a failure occurs, customers often search for explanations for the causes of failures (Bitner, 1990; Folkes, 1984; Folkes, Koletsky, & Graham, 1987) and make causal attributions to assure why a failure occurred (Weiner, 2000). Attributions are made for both positive and negative outcomes, but it is typically negative events, such as service or product failures, that elicit the greatest attribution activity (Folkes, 1984). Attribution theory suggests that customers make judgments about the cause and effect relationships to address a need for control of an individual’s environment that influences his or her subsequent emotions, attitudes, and behaviors (Weiner, 1985). In Heider’s (1958) seminal writing on naive psychology, an internal–external causal dimension is identified as fundamental to the attribution process. Causal inferences made by customers influence their future actions (Folkes, 1984; Swanson & Davis, 2003; Swanson & Kelley, 2001a). In a service failure, the customer perceives that he or she is being treated unfairly and will attempt to make sense of what has occurred by engaging in attribution processes (Bitner, 1990; Folkes & Kotsos, 1986; Sparks & Callan, 1996).

___Componenets___
   There are situations like during service encounter which something unexpected or negative events happens, when these unexpected events happens, customers infer or attribute blame and try to allocate responsibility for events (Folkes, 1988; Weiner, 2000). Weiner (1980) classified the causes of the product failures into three categories or dimensions: locus of control, stability, and controllability.

___Consequences___
  Attribution theory has previously provided significant insights into product failure experiences. For example, failure attributed toa seller is more likely to 1 ) elicit complaints to the firm and warnings to others (Richins 1983; Curren and Folkes 1987); 2) lead to less satisfaction (Oliver and DeSarbo 1988); and 3) impact beliefs that the customer is owed apologies and/or refunds (Folks 1984; Kelley, Hoffman, and Davis 1993). If a customer determines that the responsible party for a failure had control over the cause they will be angrier, have lower repurchase intentions, and have a greater desire to complain (Folkes, Koletsky, and Graham 1987). Stability has been found to influence the type of redress preferred when a product fails; "compared to unstable reasons, stable attributions lead consumers to more strongly prefer refunds rather than exchanges" (Folkes 1988, p. 557). When product failure is perceived as due to stable factors the customer believes failure will re-occur and they express a desire for a monetary refund. If the failure is perceived as due to unstable causes, then subsequent product satisfaction isexpected and product exchange is preferred (Folkes 1984). 
  In sum, attributions have been found to influence how consumers communicate (Richins 1983; Curren and Folkes 1987; Folkes, Koletsky, and Graham 1987), satisfaction or dissatisfaction (Oliver and DeSarbo 1 988), preferred recovery (Folkes 1984; 1988), and future repurchase intentions (Folkes, Koletsky, and Graham 1987). As with product failures, attribution theory may also provide insights into consumer perceptions and intentions relative to service recovery experiences.
## 1. The locus of control
___Definition___
  Locus of control refers to whether the cause of a failure is located in the customer or in the service organization (Hess et al., 2003). For example, when a failure, such as delivery failure occurs, customers make attribution on whether it was the responsibility of salesperson or not. When a failure is firm related, customers feel that they deserve a refund and an apology (Folkes, 1984). On the other hand, the greater the number of customer-related causes, the more likely consumers will do nothing when dissatisfied (Oliver, 1997). The locus dimension has been derived from Heider’s (1958) work on attribution theory.

  While the locus attribution is important for some failure events, many researchers have excluded this attribution because most causes of failures are perceived by customers to originate with service organizations (rather than within customers) making the locus attribution unambiguous, and thus less relevant for most situations (Bitner, 1990; Folkes et al., 1987; Hess et al., 2003; Smith, Bolton, & Wagner, 1999). Because our focus also involves failures that occur within organizations, this study also eliminates the locus attribution and focuses exclusively on attributions of controllability and stability.
## 2. Stability
  Stability refers to whether causes are perceived as relatively permanent and unchanging or as temporary and fluctuating (Folkes, 1984), when a salesperson is perceived to be responsible for the failure that occurred, the customer will further assess why the event occurred and attribute the event to either a stable cause or an unstable cause. Failures with stable causes happen again more frequently than failures whose causes are not stable, creating considerable problems for an organization. Attributions to unstable reasons lead to uncertainty about future outcomes, whereas stable attributions lead a person to expect the same outcome in the future (Weiner, 2000).
  Heider(1985) recognized that some attributional characteristic fluctuate, such as effort and luck, while other are relatively fixed, ability. This stability of a a cause determines shifts in expectancies (Weiner, 1980). Thus, if circumstances are perceived to remain the same or stable, then outcomes experienced will be presumed to continue. However, if the causal conditions are perceived as being likely to change or unstable, there will be uncertainty about subsequent outcomes

## 3. Controllability
  Attribution theory also recognizes that individuals are not always constrained by environmental factors, but make choices. Heider (1985) related controllability to credit and blame. For example, if an organization has control in preventing a service failure, but fails to do so, consumers may blame the firm. Conversely, the company may be more likely to be given credit for positive actions. Controllability refers to the degree to which a focal party perceives a cause to be volitional or non-volitional (Hess et al., 2003). This attribution involves the customer’s beliefs about whether the service organization could influence or prevent a failure from occurring (Hamilton, 1980; Weiner, 2000). When customers feel the cause of the failure is not internal and controllable, they assess less blame to other entities such as the manufacturer or retailer, but, when they are controllable and internal, they blame the service provider, and therefore, they may feel angry and a desire to hurt the firm’s business (Folkes, 1984).

  Individuals experience and/ or witness events and make inferences about the causes of these occurrences in classified within the three principal dimensions of stabiility (Is the cause likely to recure?), locus (who is responsible?), and controllability (Did the responsible party have control over the cause?) (Bitner, 1990)
