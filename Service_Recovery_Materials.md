# Culture vs. Service Recovery

1. The role of culture in the perception of SR
- Cultural differences on consumer satisfaction seems to indicte fundamental difference in the way consumers evaluate products and services as well as the way satisfaction/ dissatisfaction is expressed (Chiu et al., 1987; Hernandez et al., 1991; Yau, 1988)

- The high level of human involvement (both service provider and customer) in the 'manufacture' and delivery of many service means the quality of service delivery is often dependent on the attitude and behavior of front-line employees, the expectation of customers, and even the bahvior of other customers.

# RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

## [SF and SR in Hospitality and Tourism: a review of literature and recommendations for future studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erdogan-Koc/publication/328722656_Service_failures_and_recovery_in_hospitality_and_tourism_a_review_of_literature_and_recommendations_for_future_research/links/6087192a8ea909241e28bad1/Service-failures-and-recovery-in-hospitality-and-tourism-a-review-of-literature-and-recommendations-for-future-research.pdf)
__Customer Satisfaction, Loyalty, Service quality__
- __Waiting time__ is so important that delays in recovery may nullify no matter what recovery strategy was implemented.
- __service recovery paradox__ refers to a situation in which secondary satisfaction following a failure and recovery effort is higher than the pre-failure satisfaction

Villi and Koc’s (2018) 
explored the influence of the attractiveness of hospitality employees on customers’ service failure perceptions and responses towards service failures.
- This study showed that customers gave milder responses to service failures when the service employee was more attractive.

Aguilar-Rojas, Fandos-Herrera, and Flavián-Blanco (2015)
- in a service failure setting, behavioural intentions are conditioned by customers’ cognitive, affective and socio-demographic characteristics
- consumers evaluated service recoveries not only in terms of the results but also with respect to the personal attention they received during this the recovery process.

__Culture__

Hofstede (1983)
- cultural dimensions concentrated on the original four dimensions (power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism – collectivism, masculinity – femininity)

=> indulgence and restraint dimension

__Equity, Justic, and Fairness__

Oliver (2000)
- a framework (distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice) to understand customer’s perceptions of service failures and recovery attempts.

Mattila and Cranage (2005) 
- influence of choice in service recovery actions on the fairness perceptions of customers.

=> investigate service failures and recovery from the perspective of the illusion of control and decisional control, as well as other types of control.

__Empowerment__

__Attibution__

Weiner (1986)
- use the attribution framework (locus of causality, controllability and stability)

Chang’s (2008)
- investigated the concept of attribution from the perspective of emotions, equity and satisfaction judgements of tourists.

Swanson and Hsu’s (2011)
- the influence of the recovery locus attributions and service severity on word-of-mouth communication and repurchase intentions in the hospitality industry,
