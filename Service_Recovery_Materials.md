- Cultural differences on consumer satisfaction seems to indicte fundamental difference in the way consumers evaluate products and services as well as the way satisfaction/ dissatisfaction is expressed (Chiu et al., 1987; Hernandez et al., 1991; Yau, 1988)

# RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

## [SF and SR in Hospitality and Tourism: a review of literature and recommendations for future studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erdogan-Koc/publication/328722656_Service_failures_and_recovery_in_hospitality_and_tourism_a_review_of_literature_and_recommendations_for_future_research/links/6087192a8ea909241e28bad1/Service-failures-and-recovery-in-hospitality-and-tourism-a-review-of-literature-and-recommendations-for-future-research.pdf)
__Customer Satisfaction, Loyalty, Service quality__
- __Waiting time__ is so important that delays in recovery may nullify no matter what recovery strategy was implemented.
- __service recovery paradox__ refers to a situation in which secondary satisfaction following a failure and recovery effort is higher than the pre-failure satisfaction

Villi and Koc’s (2018) 
explored the influence of the attractiveness of hospitality employees on customers’ service failure perceptions and responses towards service failures.
- This study showed that customers gave milder responses to service failures when the service employee was more attractive.

Aguilar-Rojas, Fandos-Herrera, and Flavián-Blanco (2015)
- in a service failure setting, behavioural intentions are conditioned by customers’ cognitive, affective and socio-demographic characteristics
- consumers evaluated service recoveries not only in terms of the results but also with respect to the personal attention they received during this the recovery process.

__Culture__

Hofstede (1983)
- cultural dimensions concentrated on the original four dimensions (power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism – collectivism, masculinity – femininity)

=> indulgence and restraint dimension

__Equity, Justic, and Fairness__

Oliver (2000)
- a framework (distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice) to understand customer’s perceptions of service failures and recovery attempts.

Mattila and Cranage (2005) 
- influence of choice in service recovery actions on the fairness perceptions of customers.

=> investigate service failures and recovery from the perspective of the illusion of control and decisional control, as well as other types of control.

__Empowerment__

__Attibution__

Weiner (1986)
- use the attribution framework (locus of causality, controllability and stability)

Chang’s (2008)
- investigated the concept of attribution from the perspective of emotions, equity and satisfaction judgements of tourists.

Swanson and Hsu’s (2011)
- the influence of the recovery locus attributions and service severity on word-of-mouth communication and repurchase intentions in the hospitality industry,
## the influence of Zeigarnik effect
