# Literature Review
## Definition
### Stability
Stability refers to the extent to which customers believe that a cause of a failure is temporary or enduring (Folkes, 1984)


### Controllability


## The Role of Attribution theory in the service recovery
  Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that the attribution of controllability and stability is related to several important affective and behavioral outcomes (Bitner, 1990; Choi & Mattila, 2008; Folkes, 1984; Hess Jr. et al., 2003; Tsiros, Mittal, & Ross, 2004). Prospect theory and mental accounting principles suggest that losses from service failures are weighed more heavily than gains received during service recovery (Smith et al., 1999). Therefore, the attribution of controllability and stability has a significant negative effect on customer satisfaction (Bitner, 1990; Tsiroset al., 2004). Diaz and Ruiz (2002) found that customers are less likely to be satisfied when the cause of a failure or delay is perceived as stable. Leong, Ang, and Low (1997) examined the effects of service failures, physical environments, and various attributions on customers’ service evaluation and satisfaction and found that in the case of a failure, they are more likely to be dissatisfied when they perceive that the service provider has more control over the cause and when the failure occurs frequently. Customers update their assessments of service and incorporate them into their dissatisfaction judgments only when they consider the cause of a failure to be stable (Tsiros et al., 2004). The future negative impacts of a service failure due to an unstable cause are lesser; thus, customers are more forgiving when it comes to this type of failure as opposed to one with a stable cause (Magnini, Ford, Markowski, Jr, & Honeycutt, 2007). In addition, based on the findings of Smith and Bolton (1998) and Vázquez-Casielles, del Río-Lanza, and DíazMartín (2007), customers who perceive the cause of a service failure to be stable are expected to be more dissatisfied than customers who believe the failure was due to chance. When customers feel that a failure is controllable by the service provider, they are more likely to experience anger. Because anger is a sign of dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction is more likely when the service failure is within the provider’s control (Folkes, 1988; Taylor, 1994). Choi and Mattila (2008) recently examined the effects of perceived controllability on customers’ reactions in the context of service failure and found that satisfaction with an encounter is lower when the customer perceives the provider as having the ability to prevent the failure but not doing so than when the customer feels partly responsible for the failure or when the degree of a firm’s controllability is not known to the customer. Therefore, when customers perceive that a service failure is out of their service provider’s control, they tend to be more understanding and forgiving (Maxham & Netemeyer, 2002) than if they believe that the service provider could have predicted and prevented the failure (Folkes, 1984). For example, if an unexpected influx of customers during a typically slow period causes a long wait, a customer is more understanding than if the wait is caused by understaffing during a typically busy period (Magnini et al., 2007).

# Hypothesis
* Stability is negatively related to recovery satisfaction.
* Controllability is negatively related to recovery satisfaction.

# Measurement Scales
### Locus of Casuality
### Stability
* The cause of service failure was something temporary/ permanent.
* The cause of the service failure was something that varied over time/ was stable over time
* The cause of the service failure was something changeable/ unchangeable.
### Controllability
* The cause of the service failure was something uncontrollable/ controllable
* The cause of the service failure was something unpreventable/ preventable.
* The cause of the service failure was something unavoidable/ avoidable.
### Recovery satisfaction
* I am satisfied with the manner in which the service failurewas resolved.
* This airline’s response to the service failure was better than expected.
* I now have a more positive attitude toward this airline.
* Regarding this particular event, I am satisfied with this airline’s recovery effort.
* Overall, I am satisfied with the service I received.
