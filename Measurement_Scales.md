Specifically, the scale for service failure attributions was adapted from previous studies in psychology and marketing (Bulman & Wortman, 1977; Hess et al., 2003; Russell, 1982). Distributive justice was measured by a fouritem scale adopted from Blodgett et al. (1997) and Smith et al. (1999). The procedural justice was measured by a four-item scale adapted from Blodgett et al. (1997) and Karatepe (2006). To measure the interactional justice construct, we used a five-item scale adapted from Karatepe (2006), Smith et al. (1999), and Tax et al. (1998). Finally, the scale for recovery satisfaction was adapted from Bitner (1990), Brown and Leigh (1996), and Davidow (2000). Likert scales (ranging from 1 to 7), with anchors ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” were used for all construct items. The survey items were pre-tested by a small number of airline passengers to seek for feedback on questionnaire design and in order to improve the overall quality of the questionnaire.
